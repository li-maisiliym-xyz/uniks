#+title: Uniks

* A more correct =unix=
Uniks is slated to be the first [[hob:sajban][sajban]]
dialect. It aims to provide a /correct/ runtime for
[[hob:krios][kriOS]] using linux. It can be thought of
as an evolved version of [[hob:guix][guix]], which is used
for the bootstrap version.

* Notes
** Guile shortcomings
Slot types are commented out since guile's MOP is incomplete,
lacking slot-types (which really disqualifies it from being called a MOP),
and skiim's =define-datom=, which would not currently type-check the slot,
fails to evaluate due to another guile bug.
